 React Gallery App

 Used the very popular and in-demand React library to create an image gallery app.


    Created the app with the inbuilt Create-React-App function. 
    Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
    Used React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
    Used the Axios Api to fetch data from the Flickr API and used it to display images in the app.
    Added logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.


How to get started:

1. Download the files
2. Create a new file "config.js" to store your own apiKey (non-commercial) which you will get on https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply 
3. Save the file in the src folder and set it up like this:
        const apiKey = 'your key here';


        export default apiKey;

4. in the terminal(linux-terminal recommended): browse to the gallery directory and enter npm start 
5. the page will be loaded automatically, if not, open the web-browser and enter localhost:3000
